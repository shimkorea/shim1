  Phojournalist Shim Hyun-chul
  Shim Hyun-chul, photojournalist for The Korea Times, won an award at an annual news photography contest hosted by the Korea Press Photographers Association (KPPA).
With his photo titled "The Last Bow," featuring the late Keangnam Enterprises Chairman Sung Woan-jong, Shim won the runner-up prize in the "people in the news" category for the 52nd annual contest.
In the photo published in last year's April 9 edition, Sung bows during a press conference in Seoul held the previous day where he denied allegations of embezzlement and influence-peddling.
A day after the conference, Sung committed suicide, making the photo one of his last official appearances. He left behind a list of eight politicians who allegedly received kickbacks from him, two of whom the prosecution indicted.
Shim, who joined The Korea Times in 2006, has won seven other photo awards from the association.
Besides Shim's photo, the KPPA honored 38 photos in 11 categories. The award-winning pieces will be exhibited at COEX in southern Seoul May 3-15.</p><p

  Known for the broad range of subject matter he is able to interpret, he is widely recognized for his unusual celebrity portraiture, his scientific photography, photo illustrations, drawings and photojournalistic stories.
